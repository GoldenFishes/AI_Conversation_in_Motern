### Allen: Rethinking MAS Design through Step-Level Policy Autonomy



## Abstract

We intruduce a new Multi-Agent System (MAS) —— Allen, in order to address two core challenges in current MAS design: (1) improve system's policy autonomy, empowering agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral strategies, and (2) achieving the trade-off between collaborative efficiency, task supervision, and human oversight in complex network topologies. 

Our key insight involves redefining the minimal execution unit within MAS, enabling agents to autonomously assemble these units to form diverse operational modes.
