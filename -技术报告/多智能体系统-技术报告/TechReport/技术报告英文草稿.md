### Allen: Rethinking MAS Design through Step-Level Policy Autonomy



## Abstract

We intruduce a new Multi-Agent System (MAS) —— Allen, in order to address two core challenges in current MAS design: (1) improve system's policy autonomy, empowering agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral strategies, and (2) achieving the trade-off between collaborative efficiency, task supervision, and human oversight in complex network topologies. 

Our key insight involves redefining the minimal execution unit within MAS, enabling agents to autonomously assemble these units to form diverse operational modes. Concurrently, we construct a four-level state architecture encompassing Task, Stage, Agent, and Step layers. This structure collaboratively constrains system behaviors from both dual mission and execution perspectives, and achieving unification between topological optimization and progress controllability.

Allen achieves unprecedented policy autonomy, with the project open-sourced at: https://github.com/motern88/Allen
